A quick map of the different kinds of stories we all make

This is for: writers, game designers, filmmakers, teachers, and anyone who works with story on purpose.

This is a simple map of story territory. Not rules or rankings. Just a way to see how wide the field really is -  
from myths and novels to memes, games, rituals, and everyday anecdotes. If you create anything with narrative in it,  
you’re somewhere on this map.

Use this as a checklist or brainstorming board.  
Ask: where does my project sit? What nearby territories could I borrow from?

# Domains Explicitly Out of Interfacing Scope

The following are **valid semantic domains**, but the framework does not
directly interface with them. These domains are constrained, deterministic,
or optimised for correctness rather than meaning.

The framework may describe, document, or metaphorically reference them,
but does not claim operational authority within them.

---

## A. Purely Mechanical Domains

- Arithmetic
- Logic proofs
- Checksums
- Cryptographic primitives
- Hashing and encoding primitives

---

## B. Fully Constrained and Deterministic Systems

- Low-level protocols
- Signal encoding specifications
- Clocked systems
- State machines
- Hardware timing and sequencing
- Formal grammars used as execution constraints

---

## C. Precision-First Verification Domains

- Measurement and calibration
- Timing analysis
- Formal verification
- Safety-critical validation
- Proof systems where ambiguity is an error

---

Suggestion:

If this map feels too abstract, try picking one domain and asking: what does it do well that my current story does not?

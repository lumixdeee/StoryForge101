What narrative looks like under the hood


When you put a story into a computer, it does not see heroes, villains, or plot twists.

It sees structure.

A story becomes a container filled with ordered pieces of information.

For example, a simple scene might break down into:

A line of dialogue from one character

A reply from another character

A description of the setting

A note about what happened next

Each piece is stored with labels. Not emotional labels. Structural ones.

The computer tracks things like:

Who produced this line

Whether it is dialogue, description, or summary

When it happens in the timeline

Whether it is presented as fact, quotation, or imagination

To a computer, “fiction” and “non-fiction” are not fundamentally different categories. 
If two texts share the same structure and labeling, they are processed in the same way.

A courtroom transcript and a novel scene may look different to us. 
Inside a computer, they are both ordered chains of labeled statements.

This matters for creators because it reveals something important:

Story is not magic. It is organized change over time.

Someone speaks. Someone responds. Something shifts. The sequence continues.

If you understand that a story is built from structured, labeled pieces, you gain leverage. You can:

Clarify who is speaking and why

Control the timeline more precisely

Separate description from action

Make the status of information explicit

Under the surface, stories are systems.

Once you see the system, you can design it on purpose.

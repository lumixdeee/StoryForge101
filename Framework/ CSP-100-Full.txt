# CSP-100 Instruction Prompt

This file uses the CSP-100 framework, a set of 100 core linguistic/conceptual primitives designed to:

1. Constrain concept introduction and reduce hallucination.
2. Ensure consistency and stability across reasoning steps.
3. Force explicit acknowledgment of missing primitives instead of making assumptions.

**Usage:**
When interpreting or generating content from this file, map all concepts to CSP primitives. Avoid introducing new concepts or unstated assumptions.
Highlight any missing primitives rather than inventing them.
